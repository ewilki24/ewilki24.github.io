        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>  I've lived in Statesville, NC for my entire life up until I came to Charlotte for school. 
                I grew up being extremely close with my family and love being with them more than anything, it's never a dull moment. </li>

            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I started working at 18 and a local restaurant called “Ol'Bobs BBQ & Catering” as a front counter worker, 
                taking orders and keeping things stocked. Then after my freshman year of college, I began working at a company with my Dad called “Engage2Excel” as 
                an assembler assembling recognition awards for various companies on and off for the last year. I am now seeking employment on or off campus but an 
                internship would also be great as well. </li>

            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am a junior at UNCC earning a BA in Computer Science concentrating in Information Technology.</li>

            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> The most background I have in the subject is what I have learned so far but I really enjoy it.</li>

            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Mac and Apple products.</li>

            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong></li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>CJUS 2380 - Intro to Law Enforcement:</strong> I've always had a passion for criminal justice and I needed a general elective.</li>

                <li><strong>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design and Development:</strong> Required course, had to take it but have been having fun with it.</li>

                <li><strong>ITSC 3688 - Comp & Their Impact on Society:</strong> Required course, I needed to take it and it seemed interesting so I figured why not.</li>

                <li><strong>STAT 1220 - Elements of Stat I:</strong> It's a required course that I had to take, just want it out of the way.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting to Remember me by:</strong> I love any and all things Bigfoot. For my 20th birthday, my parents and cousins took me to the Bigfoot 
                festival in Marion, NC and it's just a silly thing that never fails to make me happy. </li>

            <li><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong> Let me be in the mountains at sunset and I will be content. I also really enjoy concerts and mini trips with my cousins.</li>
        </ul>
