        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Purpose: </strong>The purpose of this website is to inform people about prayer 
                shawls and how they are made and can get involved.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Intended Users: </strong> This site's intended audience is people interested in 
                learning prayer shawls and/or how they are made if they want to get involved in that process.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Overall: </strong> Overall this content is more of an informative situation about a church 
                group in my hometown who are learning to make prayer shawls via crocheting and how other people can 
                get involved in doing the same. I was specifically asked to not provide an ordering application.

        <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
        <p>
            I plan on having a comment section so people can submit their names and a comment about the webpage or if they have any questions about the prayer shawls. I will 
            possibly implement a small gallery of Prayer Shawls that have been made by a church group within the area as this church group is still fairly new. There will also 
            be several different links throughout the site to potentially the church's website and several links to provide where the information is coming from and further explanation.
