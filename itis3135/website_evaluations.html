        <fieldset>
            <h3><a href="https://www.history.com/">Good Website</a></h3>
            <p>This is the main homepage of the History Channel website that consist of recent episodes that have aired and shows produced by "History".</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> No color clashes too much and everything stands out as it should.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Everything is consistent throughout that I noticed from fonts to visuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Website was strategically aligned to provide as much content as possible, but clear as possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Content is grouped together based on new episodes and upcoming episodes.</li>
            </ul>
        </fieldset>

        <fieldset>
            <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">Bad Website</a></h3>
            <p>This seems to be a foreign website that sells a lot of machinery like ATV's, Go-Carts, and more.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Many different colors, some things stand out but others clash with some random highlights throughout the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There are repeated elements but the only consistent thing is the font on the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> There is little to no alignment on the page, evrything is just randomly placed.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Everything seems to be sectioned off but within that, it is incredibly placed randomly. What I mean by this is what is being "sold" isn't grouped by a category.</li>
            </ul>
        </fieldset>
