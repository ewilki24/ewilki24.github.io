        <h3>Checklist</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your submission leads right to the page to be reviewed</li>
            <p>It was really easy to find the client project, was led right were I needed to be.</p>

            <li>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names</li>
            <p>
                From what I saw there was one name capitalize on the home page, however I believe that may be 
                a image name. Besides that there were no spaces and everthing was names appropriately.
            </p>

            <li>General Cleanliness of code</li>
            <p>
                Code was clean, I was able to see what was where, easy to read.
            </p>

            <li>HTML/CSS Verifications</li>
            <p>
                When I checked the certifications there were some errors that came up, would definitely recommend
                looking into that.
            </p>
        </ul>

        <h3>CRAP Principles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast</li>
            <p>
                The color scheme is good, the colors don't clash and the classic red and black really mesh well the background.
            </p>

            <li>Repetition</li>
            <p>
                Everything remains consistent throughout the website. There are some repeated pictures but I assume that's intentional.
            </p>

            <li>Alignment</li>
            <p>
                I will say there seems to be some alignment issues. One thing I noticed in the "About Us" page was red text and black text 
                overlap each other making it a little difficult to read. Alignments could use some cleaning up however I like the style you have 
                throughout the site, it seems to go with your theme.
            </p>

            <li>Proximity</li>
            <p>
                I'm personally having a hard time seeing the proxmity, if you clean up the alignment I think it will help the proximity as well.
            </p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Main</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Layout includes header, footer, main, id and class tags. Consistency of 
                layout across pages. Appropriate content on the home page including images.
            </li>
            <p>
                Website is consistent throughout the pages from the header, main, and footer. The content and images are used appropriately per page.
            </p>

            <li>Link to all 4 mandatory pages and links work on all the pages. Bar is consistent position across pages.</li>
            <p>
                All the pages and links were as needed and work. Bar is consistent, I didn't notice it move between pages. Include from class may help
                but it's a personal preference, either way would be fine in my opinion.
            </p>

            <li>Appropriate content on each page including images.</li>
            <p>
                All content and images are appropriate per page.
            </p>
        </ul>
