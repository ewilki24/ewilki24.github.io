        <h2>Get Involved!</h2>

        <p>
            This ministry was created in the late 90s by two ladies who combined the things they
            loved.

        </p>
        <p>
            There are several ways to get involved, the first one being created a group at church
            like Monticello did. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way is making some for those in your personal life, you don't need to be a part
            of a church to do them.

            This is an amazing cause with an amazing history...
