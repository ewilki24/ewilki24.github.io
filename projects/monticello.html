        <h2>How did Monticello get involved?</h2>

        <p>
            New Salem United Methodist Church is a church in Statesville, NC known 
            for making prayer shawls.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lady at Monticello Methodist Church, who knew how to crochet, heard about this
            and decdied to get together with other ladies of the church and create a crochet 
            group to teach more people of the congregation how to crochet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this group is to teach these people how to crochet to eventually 
            help make more prayer shawls for the community of Statesville.
        </p>
