        <h2>How did Monticello get involved?</h2>

        <p>
            New Salem United Methodist Church is a church in Statesville, NC known 
            for making prayer shawls.
        </p>
        <p>
            A members at Monticello Methodist Church, who knew how to crochet, heard about this
            ministry and decided to get together with other members of the church and create a crochet 
            group to teach more people of the congregation how to crochet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this group is to teach these people how to crochet to eventually 
            help make more prayer shawls for the community in and outside of Statesville.
        </p>
