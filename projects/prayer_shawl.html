        <h2>What is a Prayer Shawl?</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>History of the Prayer Shawl</h3>
            <p>
                Prayer Shawls are typically worn by Jewish men while attending synagogue.
                They wear them over their heads during prayer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bible does not require prayer shawls, however, it requires a specific tassels
                which they make into prayer shawls.
            </p>
            <p>
                This requirement is acknowledged is Deuteronmony 22:12 NRSV

                <em>You shall make tassels on the four corners of the cloak with which you cover yourself.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                An important thing to note is that prayer shawls are not required by Christian faith, it's an
                individual decision.
